<h1>Assignment 2 reflection</h1>
<ul>
    <li id="first">
        <h2 id="firsth">What challenges did you encounter?</h2>
        <p id="firstp">One of the most challenging part in this assignment was creating concept for this imaginary event. Even though it is not exactly related to coding the webpage, but without
        understanding what you want to get in the end is a bit confusing. Another challenge that I faced with was creating CSS page. The float tag was often creating a bit of a mess on the webpage.
        After spending several hours trying to overcome these difficulties I managed to create event and webpage that I like.</p>
    </li>

    <li id="second">
        <h2 id="secondh">How did you approach troubleshooting and debugging?</h2>
        <p id="secondp">Just like with assignment one I was using both HTML and CSS Checkers. Once I got minor mistakes in HTML which I found while using HTML Checker, but I got rid of them and didn't have any errors again.
        As for CSS few times I faced with the problem when it wasn't showing up, but root of the problem was that I wrote wrong selector. CSS Checker never found any problem.</p>
    </li>

    <li id="third">
        <h2 id="thirdh">What did you learn while doing this web development project?</h2>
        <p id="thirdp">While doing this assignment I was able to piece together all the information that I learned about CSS during this course. Especially I understand how exactly float and position tags are working.
            I also learned that creating CSS is essential for every webpage because with it, we can make unique memorable design.</p>
    </li>

    <li id="fourth">
        <h2 id="fourthh">What did you find most challenging about the assignment, and how did you overcome it?</h2>
        <p id="fourthp">This assignment was more challenging than first. It took more time and needed more concentration from me. All the challenges I encountered, especially with floating
        I overcome using previous lecture recordings and reading articles on W3Schools. Nevertheless, I spent much time with my classmates discussing this assignment.
        I also spent many hours just playing with CSS and watching how exactly it works.</p>
